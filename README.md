# SUKU Token Lists
Welcome to the official token lists of the SUKU ecosystem.

List versions must follow the rules:
* Increment major version when tokens are removed
* Increment minor version when tokens are added
* Increment patch version when tokens already on the list have minor details changed (name, symbol, logo URL, decimals)

For more information, please see: https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists
